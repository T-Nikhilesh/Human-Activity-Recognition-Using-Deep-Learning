# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning

The field of deep learning is expanding, which makes it easier to create software and gadgets that are intelligent and can help people with their daily tasks. Human Activity Recognition(HAR) is a well-known application of deep learning. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is used effectively to identify human behaviors. In this study, we developed a model that used Long Short-Term Memory with Convolutional Networks(LRCN) and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory(ConvLSTM) to detect human actions. This model was trained using the UCF50 dataset, which allowed for extensive testing and validation. By splitting the main dataset(UCF50) into two sections— testing and validation—each with ten action categories, an additional dataset is produced.  When applied to the following dataset, the accuracy of the ConvLSTM model is 81.4%, while the accuracy of the LRCN model is 85.3%.
